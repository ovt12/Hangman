Welcome to my Hangman Java project!

This is a simple command-line based game where the user attempts to guess a word by suggesting letters. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the user suggests a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions. If the user suggests a letter which does not exist in the word, the script decrements the number of "lives" left. The user has 5 lives to guess the word. If the user completes the word before the lives run out, they win. Otherwise, they lose.
